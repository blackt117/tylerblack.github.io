    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello! I'm Tyler Black, a graduate student at the University of North Carolina Wilmington (UNCW) pursuing a Master of Science in Computer Science & Information Systems. I graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Mathematics from East Carolina University, and I have a deep passion for data science, software engineering, and statistical programming.
    </p>
    <p>
        With a strong background in mathematics and professional experience in biostatistics, I specialize in statistical programming, machine learning, and data analysis. I aim to apply my skills to solve complex problems in industries like healthcare, technology, or finance.
    </p>
    <p>
        I am driven by the pursuit of knowledge and innovation, and I'm always excited about new challenges in data science and software development.
